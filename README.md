# GCP Security Training Lab: 3-Tier Architecture

**Hands-on, modular security training for Google Cloud Platform**

A practical security lab that teaches GCP security fundamentals through progressive modules. Each module adds security layers to a 3-tier web application, building from basic network controls to advanced enterprise security patterns.

## üéØ Training Philosophy

**Learning by Building**: Deploy real infrastructure, not theoretical examples  
**Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add advanced security layer by layer  
**Infrastructure as Code**: Everything in Terraform for repeatability and best practices  
**Security First**: Every decision explained through a security lens  
**Enterprise Ready**: Patterns used in real production environments  

## üèóÔ∏è Lab Architecture

You'll build this secure 3-tier architecture progressively:

```
Internet ‚Üí Cloud Load Balancer ‚Üí Web Tier (Public Subnet)
                ‚Üì (Controlled Access)
           App Tier (Private Subnet)  
                ‚Üì (Database Only)
         Database Tier (Private Subnet)
```

Each module adds security controls and explains the "why" behind every configuration.
