4. **Emergency Shutdown Procedures**

## üîß Part 1: Your Professional Toolkit

These tools are industry standard for DevSecOps professionals. Installing them properly is your first professional skill demonstration.

### **Essential Tools Checklist**

#### **Terraform CLI** - Infrastructure as Code Foundation
**Purpose**: Define and manage cloud infrastructure with code instead of clicking through consoles.

**Installation:**
- **Windows**: Download from [HashiCorp Terraform Releases](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/)
- **macOS**: `brew install terraform`
- **Linux**: Use package manager or download binary

**Verification**: Run `terraform version` - you should see version 1.0 or higher.

**Why This Matters**: Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure as code. Mastering it is essential for any cloud role.

#### **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)** - GCP Command Line Interface
**Purpose**: Interact with GCP services from your terminal and authenticate Terraform.

**Installation:**
- **All Platforms**: Follow [Google Cloud SDK Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **Alternative**: Use Google Cloud Shell (browser-based, pre-installed)

**Verification**: Run `gcloud version` - you should see the SDK version and components.

**Why This Matters**: Command-line proficiency is expected in DevSecOps roles. GUI clicking doesn't scale.

#### **Git** - Version Control System
**Purpose**: Track changes, collaborate with teams, and maintain professional code history.

**Installation:**
- **Windows**: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **macOS**: `brew install git` or Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Linux**: Use package manager (`apt install git`, `yum install git`)

**Verification**: Run `git --version`

**Configuration** (Replace with your professional information):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Professional Name"
git config --global user.email "your.professional@email.com"
```

**Why This Matters**: Git is fundamental to all software development. Your commit history demonstrates your professional growth.

#### **Code Editor** - Development Environment
**Recommended**: **Visual Studio Code** with extensions

**Installation**: Download from [VS Code Official Site](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Essential Extensions**:
- **HashiCorp Terraform**: Syntax highlighting and validation
- **GitLens**: Enhanced Git integration
- **Cloud Code**: GCP integration and debugging

**Alternative Editors**: IntelliJ IDEA, Vim, Emacs (if you have preferences)

**Why This Matters**: Professional developers use proper IDEs with syntax highlighting, error detection, and integrated debugging.

### **Installation Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**PATH Problems (Tool not found after installation)**:
- **Windows**: Add installation directory to System PATH via Environment Variables
- **macOS/Linux**: Add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell config
- **Verification**: Open new terminal and test commands

**Permission Errors**:
- **Windows**: Run installer as Administrator
- **macOS/Linux**: Use `sudo` for system-wide installation or install to user directory
- **Corporate Networks**: May need IT assistance for firewall/proxy configuration

**Version Conflicts**:
- Use version managers like `tfenv` for Terraform or `gcloud components update`
- Uninstall old versions before installing new ones
- Check for conflicting installations in different directories

**Corporate Network Issues**:
- Configure proxy settings for tools if behind corporate firewall
- May need to use alternative installation methods (offline installers)
- Contact IT for whitelist requests if downloads are blocked

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Part 2: GCP Environment Setup - The Foundation

### **Step 1: Google Account Preparation**

**If You Don't Have a Google Account:**
1. Create account at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Use a professional email address if possible
3. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** (Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification)
4. **Set up Account Recovery** (add phone number and recovery email)

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use a strong, unique password (password manager recommended)
- Enable 2FA with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Review account permissions regularly

### **Step 2: GCP Account and Project Creation**

**Activate GCP Account:**
1. Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Accept terms of service
3. **Verify Identity** (may require phone verification)
4. **Claim $300 Free Trial Credits** (requires valid credit card for verification)

**Create Your Project:**
1. Click "Select a Project" ‚Üí "New Project"
2. **Project Name**: Use descriptive, professional naming
   - Good: `gcp-security-lab-yourname`
   - Bad: `test123` or `my-project`
3. **Project ID**: Will be auto-generated (note this for later use)
4. **Organization**: Leave as "No organization" for personal projects

**Why Professional Naming Matters**: Project names appear in billing, logs, and resource URLs. Professional naming demonstrates attention to detail.

### **Step 3: Billing Account Setup and Protection**

**Create Billing Account:**
1. Navigate to **Billing** in GCP Console
2. **Create Billing Account**
3. **Add Payment Method** (required even for free tier)
4. **Link to Your Project**

**Critical: Set Up Spending Protection**

**Budget Alerts (Multiple Thresholds):**
1. Go to **Billing** ‚Üí **Budgets & Alerts**
2. **Create Budget**
3. **Configure Alerts**:
   - **$5 Alert**: 50% of expected tutorial cost
   - **$15 Alert**: 150% of expected tutorial cost  
   - **$50 Alert**: Emergency threshold
4. **Alert Recipients**: Add your email address
5. **Enable**: "Connect a Pub/Sub topic" for programmatic alerts (optional but recommended)

**Spending Limits (If Available):**
- Some account types allow hard spending limits
- Configure if available in your billing account

**Daily Monitoring Setup:**
1. **Billing Dashboard**: Bookmark for daily checks
2. **Cost Breakdown**: Monitor by service and project
3. **Usage Reports**: Track resource consumption patterns

### **Step 4: API Enablement and Authentication**

**Enable Required APIs:**
```bash
# Set your project (replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID)
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Enable essential APIs
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
```

**Authenticate Your Local Environment:**
```bash
# Authenticate gcloud CLI
gcloud auth login

# Set up Application Default Credentials for Terraform
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Verify Authentication:**
```bash
# Test gcloud access
gcloud projects list

# Test authentication
gcloud auth list
```

**Troubleshooting Authentication:**
- **Browser Issues**: Use `gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser` for headless environments
- **Corporate Networks**: May need proxy configuration
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure you have Owner or Editor role on the project

### **Step 5: Remote State Backend (Professional Infrastructure Management)**

**Why Remote State Matters:**
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on same infrastructure
- **State Locking**: Prevents concurrent modifications that could corrupt infrastructure
- **Backup**: State is safely stored in cloud, not just on your laptop
- **Audit Trail**: Changes are tracked and versioned

**Create GCS Bucket for Terraform State:**
```bash
# Create globally unique bucket name (replace with your unique identifier)
export BUCKET_NAME="terraform-state-$(whoami)-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# Create the bucket
gsutil mb -p YOUR_PROJECT_ID -l us-central1 gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/

# Enable versioning for state backup
gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/

# Verify bucket creation
gsutil ls -p YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**Security Note**: This bucket will contain sensitive infrastructure state. Never make it publicly accessible.

## üìÇ Part 3: Professional Project Structure

**Create Your Local Project Directory:**
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir gcp-security-lab
cd gcp-security-lab

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Create professional directory structure
mkdir -p {environments/dev,modules/{00-setup,01-network-security,02-iam-security}}
mkdir -p docs/{troubleshooting,security-theory}

# Create essential files
touch README.md .gitignore
touch environments/dev/{backend.tf,main.tf,terraform.tfvars,versions.tf}
```

**Professional .gitignore:**
```gitignore
# Terraform
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
*.tfvars
.terraform/
.terraform.lock.hcl
crash.log

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Credentials
*.json
*.pem
*.key
```

**Why This Structure Matters:**
- **Environments Directory**: Separates dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Modules Directory**: Reusable infrastructure components
- **Documentation**: Professional projects are well-documented
- **Git Ignore**: Prevents sensitive data from being committed

## üîê Part 4: GitHub Portfolio Setup

### **Professional GitHub Repository**

**Create Repository:**
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in/create account
2. **Repository Name**: `gcp-security-training-lab`
3. **Description**: "Production-grade GCP security implementation with Terraform - demonstrating DevSecOps best practices"

## üö® Part 5: Emergency Procedures and Cost Management

### **Daily Monitoring Routine**

**Every Day You're Working on This Lab:**
1. **Check Billing Dashboard**: Look for unexpected charges
2. **Review Resource Usage**: Ensure resources are being cleaned up
3. **Monitor Budget Alerts**: Respond immediately to any alerts

### **Emergency Shutdown Procedures**

**If You See Unexpected Charges:**

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# List all compute instances
gcloud compute instances list --format="table(name,zone,status)"

# Stop all running instances
gcloud compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE_NAME

# List all other billable resources
gcloud sql instances list
gcloud container clusters list
gcloud compute disks list
```

**Nuclear Option (Complete Project Shutdown):**
1. **GCP Console** ‚Üí **IAM & Admin** ‚Üí **Settings**
2. **Shut Down Project** (this is irreversible)
3. **Confirm Shutdown** (all resources will be deleted)

**Prevention is Better Than Cure:**
